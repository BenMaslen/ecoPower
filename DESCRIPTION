Description: Estimates power by simulation for multivariate
    abundance data to be used for sample size estimates. Multivariate
    equivalence testing by simulation from a Gaussian copula model.
    The package also provides functions for parameterising multivariate effect
    sizes and simulating multivariate abundance data jointly.
